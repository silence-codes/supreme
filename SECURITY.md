## Supported Features

Supreme 2 Light scans code for security issues but does not:
- Execute code from scanned projects
- Send data to external servers (all scanning is local)
- Require network access (except for tool installation)

## Known Limitations

- Supreme 2 Light relies on external security tools (listed in `tool-versions.lock`)
- We cannot guarantee 100% accuracy (false positives/negatives may occur)
- Tool versions are pinned for reproducibility but may lag behind latest versions

## Security Best Practices

When using Supreme 2 Light:

1. **Keep Supreme 2 Light updated** to the latest version
2. **Review scan results** - don't blindly trust all findings
3. **Use pinned tool versions** for production CI/CD
4. **Report false positives** to help us improve

## Bug Bounty

We currently do not offer a bug bounty program but deeply appreciate responsible disclosure.
